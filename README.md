# Supershop Management System
 This project is aimed at developing a web-based application named Super Shop Management System for managing any Super Shop. The Super Shop Management System refers to the system and processes to manage the stock of an organization with the involvement of the Technology system. This system can be used to store the details of the Super Shop, stock maintenance, update the inventory based on the sales details, and generate sales and inventory reports daily or weekly based. This project categorizes individual aspects of the sales and Super Shop management system. In this system, we are solving different problems affecting direct sales management and purchase management. Super Shop Management System is important to ensure quality control in businesses that handle transactions revolving around consumer goods. Without proper Super Shop control, a large retail store may run out of stock on an important item. A good Super Shop management system will alert the wholesaler when it is time to record. Super Shop Management System is also an important means of automatically tracking large shipments. An automated Super Shop Management System helps to minimize the errors while recording the stock.
